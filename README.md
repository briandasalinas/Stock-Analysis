# Stock-Analysis
## Overview 
We created a macro to help our friend Steve analyze the preformance of the Stock DAQO New Energy Corp that his parents recently bought. Steve's parents want to invest in green energy therefore bought stock for DAQO but, Steve wants to see help his parent diversify into other green energy stocks.

### Purpose 
Using the macro created, we are able to filter through the data to analysis the preformance of different green energy stocks. We are able to compare the preformance of the stock DAQO New Energy Corp, ticker label DQ, to the other stocks and see it's performance.


## Results
With the help of Microsofts Visual Basic for Excel, we were able to create a macro to compare the preformance of different green enery stocks. We were able to create a macro that would allow us to input the year we desired to analyze. Our code presented us with the following results.

### 2017
Focusing on helping Steve, we can see that the stock DQ had a very successful return in 2017 with a return of 199.7%. In 2017 DQ was the most successful stock compared to the other green energy stocks.

### 2018
On the other hand, in 2018 DQ took a sharp turn and had a negative return. DQ had a -62.6% return just a year after having a 199.7% return.

### Refactored Macro
Wanting to create a faster macro to help our friend Steve we refactored our original subroutine. We can see that our new macro is faster than the original.
Here we have the difference in time from the original macro to the rebooted macro for the year 2017. With the given data the difference is not that vast but, this macro can no be used to compare thousands of stocks in a small amount of time.

## Summary 

The stock Steve's Parents chose did preform the best in 2017 yet, it did not keep that title in 2018. Stock DQ taking such a big dip is a bad sign to keep investing in said stock. We could reccomend Steve's parents to invest in the stock ENPH since it has the most successful preformance of all the other stocks. ENPH had a whopping 130% return in 2017 and a 82% return in 2018.

Our original macro helped our friend Steve compare the dozen green energy stocks just like we wanted. Our end goal was for Steve to be able to use this code for any data he might come across. Refactoring our code made it run more efficently as well as making it easier for our friend Steve to manage it. 
While refactoring though, I came across new bugs and had to keep working on fixing new bugs that kept arising. It took some time for me to create a code that was able to run. The end goal was achieved nonetheless but, there were some bumps in the road.
