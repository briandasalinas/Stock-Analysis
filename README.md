# Stock-Analysis
## Overview 
We created a macro to help our friend Steve analyze the preformance of the Stock DAQO New Energy Corp that his parents recently bought. Steve's parents want to invest in green energy therefore bought stock for DAQO but, Steve wants to see help his parent diversify into other green energy stocks.

### Purpose 
Using the macro created, we are able to filter through the data to analysis the preformance of different green energy stocks. We are able to compare the preformance of the stock DAQO New Energy Corp, ticker label DQ, to the other stocks and see it's performance.


## Results
Focusing on helping Steve, we can see that the stock DQ had a very successful return in 2017.

## Summary 

The stock Steve's Parents choose did the preformed the best in the year 2017 yet it too a sharp turn in the year 2018. Stock DQ being in the negatives is a bad sign to keep investing in said stock. We could reccomend to invest in the stock ENPH since it has the most successful preformance of all the other stocks. ENPH had a whopping 130% return in 2017 and a 82% return in 2018.
